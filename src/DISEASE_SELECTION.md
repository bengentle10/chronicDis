# Disease Selection: Malaria (DOID_12365)

## Rationale for Selection

### Public Health Impact in Ghana
- Malaria remains one of Ghana's leading causes of morbidity and mortality
- Accounts for approximately 38% of all outpatient visits
- Particularly affects children under 5 and pregnant women

### Scientific Considerations
1. Rich genetic data availability:
   - Extensive research on Plasmodium falciparum genetics
   - Well-documented host-pathogen interactions
   - Multiple drug resistance mechanisms

2. Data Quality:
   - Strong presence in OpenTargets database
   - Well-annotated disease ontology
   - Multiple known gene associations

### Potential Impact
1. Drug Discovery:
   - Identification of new drug targets
   - Understanding resistance mechanisms
   - Potential for locally relevant therapeutics

2. Public Health:
   - Better prediction of disease susceptibility
   - Improved treatment strategies
   - Support for precision medicine approaches

## Model Applications
1. Predict new gene-disease associations
2. Identify potential drug targets
3. Understand disease mechanisms
4. Support drug repurposing efforts

## Future Directions
1. Integration with local genetic data
2. Collaboration with Ghanaian research institutions
3. Extension to related tropical diseases
